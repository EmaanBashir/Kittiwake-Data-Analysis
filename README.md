# Kittiwake-Data-Analysis

The analysis presented in this report examines four distinct datasets related to kittiwakes, 
focusing on observation, measurement, historical and location data. The primary objective is to 
provide insights into the various aspects of kittiwake behavior, popular trends, physical attributes 
and habitat influences. We will address the following research questions:
1. Provide an exploratory analysis of the observation and construct a 99% confidence 
interval for the mean number of kittiwakes observed at dusk.
2. Does the historical data support the hypothesis that the decline in kittiwake numbers over 
time, is independent of site? Estimate the number of breeding pairs at site A in 2014.
3. For the measurement data,
a. Provide a visual summary of the data.
b. Check the independence of wingspan and culmen length for each sub-specie.
c. Is there evidence that the weights of birds of the two sub-species are different?
d. Is there evidence that there is a difference between the two sub-species?
4. For the location data,
a. Fit a linear model to predict the number of breeding pairs.
b. Fit a linear model to the logarithm of number of breeding pairs.
c. Choose the most appropriate linear model.
d. Comment on model fit and effect of the selected covariates.
e. Provide an 80% confidence interval for the number of breeding pairs when coastal 
direction = West, sandeel = 2.93, temperature = 27.7 and cliff height = 3.55.
